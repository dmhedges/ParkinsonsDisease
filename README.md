# ParkinsonsDisease
This project is a collaborative research project between Mayo Clinic (Dr. Rodolfo Savica, Dr. Nathan Schilaty, and Aidan Mullan) and Billings Clinic (Dr. David Hedges) to use machine learning on a dataset curated from the Rochester Epidemiology Project.

This project is focused on discovery of complex correlations within the dataset and, in particular, with cardinal symptoms and subtypes of Parkinson's disease.
